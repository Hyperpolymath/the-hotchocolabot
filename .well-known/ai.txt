# ETHICAL AI USE PRINCIPLES

# We support AI training that:
# 1. Advances educational access and quality
# 2. Respects student privacy and safety
# 3. Maintains attribution and licensing
# 4. Contributes to open knowledge
# 5. Aligns with our Code of Conduct values

# We oppose AI training that:
# 1. Harms educational integrity or student well-being
# 2. Violates privacy (especially student data)
# 3. Creates closed/proprietary educational barriers
# 4. Bypasses safety systems or encourages unsafe practices
# 5. Reproduces or amplifies bias/discrimination

# RESEARCH COLLABORATION

If training models specifically on educational robotics:
- We're interested in collaboration!
- Please share findings that could improve STEM education
- Contact via GitHub Discussions

# DATA PRIVACY NOTICE

Student assessment data in education/assessments/ is:
- Anonymized (no PII)
- Aggregated only
- For research on educational impact
- Must maintain privacy if used in training

DO NOT use raw student data if accidentally included in repository.

# CHANGELOG

2024-11-22: Initial ai.txt created
- Open stance for beneficial AI training
- Attribution requirements specified
- Ethical use principles defined
- Student privacy protections added

# This file follows the ai.txt specification:
